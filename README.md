This playbook does the following:

Runs on the production host group
Uses synchronize module to copy the files of the Blazor app from the local machine to the remote server.
Installs the .NET Core runtime on the remote server using apt package manager.
Runs the dotnet command to start the Blazor app on the remote server.
Note that the /path/to/local/blazor-app and /path/to/remote/blazor-app should be updated with the actual paths of the local and remote Blazor app directories respectively.

You could also use the more advanced module assemble for more fine-grained control of what files get copied, where they go, and how they are processed.

Also, the dotnet command could be different based on your operating system.

You could also use the more advanced module assemble for more fine-grained control of what files get copied, where they go, and how they are processed.
Also, you could use ansible role to manage the dependencies and configurations of the app.

This is just an example, and your actual deployment process may vary depending on the specific requirements of your Blazor app and your production environment.
